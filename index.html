      <h2>About This Game</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Tampa Bay Bird Identification Game! This game is designed to help you sharpen your skills in recognizing birds by sight.

        friends at a party, this game is for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll be presented with a series of images and your goal is to correctly identify the species from a list of choices.
        After each round, you can review your answers and see how you did. Your objective is to get the highest score! Good luck!
